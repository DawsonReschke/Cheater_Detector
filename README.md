# Cheater_Detector
This project was created for me, because I love playing Counter-Strike Global Offensive, but I really hate playing with or against cheaters. What this tool does is quite simple: using public account data, predict whether each player is a cheater or not based on several points of data, including: achievements, hours played, account level, account age, account comments, ban record, and  account privacy settings. Using these few data points we should be able to semi accurately predict whether or not a user is cheating. The way that the site should work (hopefully as I have yet to read the steam api documentation)  is that a user can sign in with steam, or input their steam ID while they are in the lobby and see all of the players with their specific Cheater Probabilities.
